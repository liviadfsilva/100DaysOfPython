<h1>The Best Horror Movies According to Lily<h1/>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies of All Time — Alphabetical Order</h2>

<hr />

<h3>He's Out There</h3>
<h4>"I've been watching you for a long time."</h4>
<p>
    Super creepy. It left me jaw-dropped and staring off into space at the end.
</p>

<h3>Psycho</h3>
<h4>"Well, a boy's best friend is his mother."</h4>
<p>
    One of the first classic movies I ever watched. Absolutely loved the plot twist.
</p>

<h3>Scream</h3>
<h4>"What's your favorite scary movie?"</h4>
<p>
    Ghostface is one of my favorit slashers ever. I love how cliché the movies are.
</p>

<h3>The Shining</h3>
<h4>"I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just gonna bash your brains in."</h4>
<p>
    This is my go-to movie when I'm bored. I'm a sucker for both the mbook and the movie. Amazing story!
</p>

<h3>The Witch</h3>
<h4>"Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?"</h4>
<p>
    I love the lore surrounding witchcraft. Black Philip was my favorite — he totally stole the thunder.
